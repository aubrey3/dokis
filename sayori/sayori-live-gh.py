#ok so heres the cooldowns. the current implementation goes like this:
#	after a command has been entered, add the user to the list
#	if the user tries to run the command again while their name is in the list, dont do the command
#	after 5 seconds, remove that user from the list
#it seems like there are times when that code that removes the user from the list doesnt run. what we really should do is:
#	after a command has been entered, set the users value to the time that the command was run
#	if the user tries to run the command again while their name's value is greater than the current time plus however long the cooldown is, dont do the command
#	every certain amount of time (maybe 15 to 30 minutes) clear all values that have expired (maybe even the whole map, it shouldnt hurt) so the map doesnt become huge

#of course these lists need to be changed to maps
