The raccoon becomes excited.\nor perhaps I'm merely projecting my emotions onto the newly-satisfied animal.\n\nThe raccoon has taken to following me.\nYou could say that we've gotten quite used to each other.\nThe raccoon becomes hungry more and more frequently, so my bread is always handy.\nEvery time I brandish my cutting knife the raccoon shows me its excitement.\nA rush of blood. Classic Pavlovian conditioning. I slice the bread.\nAnd I feed myself again."

The silhouette grows. Closer Closer\nI open my umbrella, casting a shadow to shield me from visibility.\nBut I am too late.\nHe steps into the streetlight. I gasp and drop my umbrella.\nThe light flickers. My heart pounds. He raises his arm.\n\nTime stops.\n\nThe only indication of movement is the amber light flickering against his outstretched\narm.\nThe flickering light is in rhythm with the pounding of my heart.\nTeasing me for succumbing to this forbidden emotion.\nHave you ever heard of a ghost feeling warmth before?\nGiving up on understanding, I laugh.\nUnderstanding is overrated.\nI touch his hand.
